# Safe Motion Planning for Complex Autonomous Driving Using Hybrid A* and Spline Functions
This repository contains the source code for two path planning algorithms, A* and hybrid A*. Both algorithms aim to identify the shortest path between two points on a grid that avoids collisions with any obstacles. The hybrid A* code includes a path smoother and velocity planner, which guarantee safety and enhance comfort for an autonomous vehicle.
